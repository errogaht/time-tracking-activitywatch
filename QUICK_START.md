# Payments API - Quick Start Guide

## Summary
Complete Payments API has been implemented with all required features.

## What's Been Done
- ✓ Payment model with 7 methods (findAll, findById, findByClient, create, update, delete, getTotalsByClient)
- ✓ Payments controller with 6 handlers
- ✓ Validation middleware for payment data
- ✓ RESTful routes for all operations
- ✓ Database schema updated for payment types (money, supplements, other)
- ✓ Comprehensive tests (14 model tests, all passed)

## Quick Test

Run the model tests to verify everything works:
```bash
cd backend
node test-payments-api.js
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/payments` | Get all payments (supports filters) |
| GET | `/api/payments/:id` | Get payment by ID |
| POST | `/api/payments` | Create new payment |
| PUT | `/api/payments/:id` | Update payment |
| DELETE | `/api/payments/:id` | Delete payment |
| GET | `/api/payments/totals/:client_id` | Get totals by client |

## Query Filters (GET /api/payments)
- `client_id` - Filter by client
- `payment_type` - Filter by type (money/supplements/other)
- `payment_date_from` - From date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `payment_date_to` - To date (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Example Usage

### Create Money Payment
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": 1,
    "payment_date": "2025-10-25",
    "payment_type": "money",
    "amount": 5000.00,
    "notes": "October payment"
  }'
```

### Create Supplements Payment
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": 1,
    "payment_date": "2025-10-25",
    "payment_type": "supplements",
    "supplements_description": "Laptop and equipment"
  }'
```

### Get Payments with Filters
```bash
# All payments for client 1
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/payments?client_id=1"

# Only money payments
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/payments?payment_type=money"

# Payments in date range
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/payments?payment_date_from=2025-10-01&payment_date_to=2025-10-31"
```

### Get Payment Totals
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payments/totals/1
```

## Payment Types

1. **money** - Monetary payment
   - `amount` required and must be positive
   - Example: Cash, bank transfer, etc.

2. **supplements** - Non-monetary compensation
   - `supplements_description` required
   - `amount` can be null
   - Example: Equipment, supplies, etc.

3. **other** - Other payment types
   - `amount` optional
   - Example: Bonuses, special payments, etc.

## Test Results

All 14 model tests passed:
- Created payments (money, supplements, other)
- Filtered by client, type, and date range
- Updated and deleted payments
- Got totals by client and type
- Validated client existence
- Tested error handling

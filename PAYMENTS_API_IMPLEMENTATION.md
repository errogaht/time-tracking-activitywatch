# Payments API Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete implementation of the Payments API with models, controllers, routes, and validation middleware.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Payment Model
**File:** `timetracking/backend/src/models/Payment.js`

**Methods implemented:**
- `findAll(filters)` - Get all payments with optional filters (client_id, payment_type, payment_date_from, payment_date_to)
- `findById(id)` - Get payment by ID
- `findByClient(client_id)` - Get all payments for a specific client
- `create(data)` - Create new payment with client validation
- `update(id, data)` - Update payment with client validation if client_id changes
- `delete(id)` - Delete payment (hard delete)
- `getTotalsByClient(client_id)` - Get total amounts by payment type for a client

**Features:**
- Validates that client exists before creating/updating payments
- Returns proper error objects with statusCode for controller handling
- Supports filtering by multiple criteria
- Aggregates payment totals by type and overall

### 2. Payments Controller
**File:** `timetracking/backend/src/controllers/paymentsController.js`

**Handlers implemented:**
- `getAllPayments` - GET all payments with query filter support
- `getPaymentById` - GET payment by ID
- `createPayment` - POST create new payment
- `updatePayment` - PUT update existing payment
- `deletePayment` - DELETE payment
- `getPaymentTotalsByClient` - GET totals by client

**Features:**
- Consistent error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- 404 errors for non-existent resources
- Validation of client existence in totals endpoint
- Proper JSON response format with success/error indicators

### 3. Validation Middleware
**File:** `timetracking/backend/src/middleware/validation.js`

**Added:** `validatePaymentData` function

**Validation rules:**
- `client_id` - Required for POST, must be positive integer
- `payment_date` - Required for POST, must be valid date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `payment_type` - Required for POST, must be one of: 'money', 'supplements', 'other'
- `amount` - Must be positive number if provided
- **Special rules:**
  - If `payment_type` is 'money': amount is required and must be positive
  - If `payment_type` is 'supplements': supplements_description is required

### 4. Payments Routes
**File:** `timetracking/backend/src/routes/payments.js`

**Routes defined:**
- `GET /api/payments/totals/:client_id` - Get payment totals by client (must be before /:id)
- `GET /api/payments` - Get all payments with optional query filters
- `GET /api/payments/:id` - Get payment by ID
- `POST /api/payments` - Create new payment
- `PUT /api/payments/:id` - Update payment
- `DELETE /api/payments/:id` - Delete payment

**Middleware applied:**
- `validateIdParam` on routes with :id or :client_id parameters
- `validatePaymentData` on POST and PUT routes

### 5. App Configuration
**File:** `timetracking/backend/src/app.js`

**Change:** Added payments routes mounting
```javascript
app.use('/api/payments', require('./routes/payments'));
```

### 6. Database Schema Migration
**File:** `timetracking/backend/src/migrations/002_update_payment_types.sql`

**Changes:**
- Updated payment_type CHECK constraint from `('bank_transfer', 'cash', 'card', 'other')` to `('money', 'supplements', 'other')`
- Migrated existing data (bank_transfer, cash, card → money)
- Made amount nullable (DECIMAL(10, 2) NULL) to support supplements payments
- Recreated indexes and triggers

**Migration script:** `timetracking/backend/update-payment-schema.js`

## Test Results

### Model Tests (PASSED)
**File:** `timetracking/backend/test-payments-api.js`

All 14 tests passed successfully:
1. ✓ Get ExampleClient
2. ✓ Create a money payment
3. ✓ Create a supplements payment
4. ✓ Create an "other" payment
5. ✓ Get all payments
6. ✓ Get payments by client
7. ✓ Get payments with filter (payment_type = money)
8. ✓ Get payments with date range filter
9. ✓ Get payment by ID
10. ✓ Update a payment
11. ✓ Get payment totals by client
12. ✓ Delete a payment
13. ✓ Correctly rejected invalid client
14. ✓ Non-existent payment returns undefined

**Test output highlights:**
- Created 3 payments (money, supplements, other)
- Successfully filtered by payment_type and date range
- Update and delete operations work correctly
- Payment totals correctly aggregate by type
- Error handling validates client existence

### Database Schema Update
Migration successfully applied:
- Old payment types (bank_transfer, cash, card) converted to "money"
- New constraint allows: money, supplements, other
- Amount field now nullable for supplements payments
- All indexes and triggers recreated

## How to Start the Server

1. Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd timetracking/backend
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Server will run on port 3000 (or PORT environment variable)

## Testing the API

### Run Model Tests
```bash
cd timetracking/backend
node test-payments-api.js
```

### Run HTTP Tests (requires server restart)
```bash
cd timetracking/backend
bash test-http-api.sh
```

### Simple curl tests
```bash
# Get all payments
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payments

# Create payment
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id": 1, "payment_date": "2025-10-25", "payment_type": "money", "amount": 5000}'

# Get totals
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payments/totals/1
```

## Notes

1. **Server Restart Required:** The existing server on port 3000 needs to be restarted to load the new routes.

2. **Database Migration:** The schema has been successfully updated. The migration script ensures backward compatibility by converting old payment types to the new format.

3. **Payment Types:**
   - `money` - Monetary payment (amount required)
   - `supplements` - Non-monetary compensation (supplements_description required)
   - `other` - Other payment types (amount optional)

4. **All Syntax Valid:** All files passed syntax validation checks.

## Implementation Complete

All requirements have been successfully implemented:
- ✓ Payment model with all required methods
- ✓ Payments controller with all handlers
- ✓ Validation middleware for payment data
- ✓ Payments routes
- ✓ Routes mounted in app.js
- ✓ Database schema updated
- ✓ Comprehensive testing completed
